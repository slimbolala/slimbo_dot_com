<h2>Ghosts of Bruisers Past</h2>
Bruisers New Orleans has existed in one form or another since the late
90s. During those years there have been a number of line-up
permutations, mainly in the drumming department. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_Tap_%28band%29#Drums.2C_percussion">How
very "Spinal
Tap"</a>.) But once a Bruiser (N.O.), always a Bruiser (N.O.).
Here's a
rundown of the Bruisers past who, though they may have drifted off to
greener pastures, are still dear to our hearts. (Sorry, no seething
schisms and dramatic splits. Our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_the_Music">VH1
"Behind the Music"</a> will be very
boring). In chronological-ish order:<br>
<blockquote>

<h3>Ana
Arrien</h3>
Ana was a founding member and our drummer for many years during the
Bruiser "Classic" line-up (a.k.a. the "Four Non-Blondes" era).
Eventually, other obligations compelled her to pass the drumsticks over
to her then-boyfriend/now-husband Zack. (Being Ana is a full-time job.)
Now she teaches fourth-grade. She's adorable.

<h3>Kate
Samworth</h3>
Kate was the "fifth Bruiser", there at the get-go, playing
sometimes-bass and sometimes-drums back when we were still trying to
figure out what the hell was going on. (We're still working on it.)
Though she only played one show with us, she made the lasting
contribution of giving us our name (a reference to Mary T.'s penchant
for affectionately-but-vigorously punching her friends, leaving
black-and-blue "love marks").</td>

</td>

<h3>Zack
LeBlanc</h3>
Zack has played in a bizillion bands. When Ana relinquished the
drum-throne, Zack offered up his well-honed chops. He was our drummer
until Katrina, when that wretched storm blew Ana and him westward. He
now spends his days in Austin, cursing the mountain-unicyclists and
pining for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muffuletta">muffulettas</a>.
He's adorable.</td>

<h3>Peggy
O'Neill</h3>
After the storm, we were drummerless. But then we found Peggy, darling
gal and former drummer for garage rock legends <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_gories">the Gories</a>.
Peggy fit
right in (though she seemed eternally perplexed by the absence of
band-fights). But then she quit smoking and couldn't hang out in bars,
which made playing in a bar band sort of untenable. She now plays
Gories reunion gigs in big fancy smoke-free venues in big fancy places
like New York City.</td>

And so, we quit fighting it. Mary learned the drums, and we've been a
trio ever since.<br>
