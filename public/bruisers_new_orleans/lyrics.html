<h2>Lyrics</h2>
Remember back when albums had the lyrics in their liner notes, and you
could sit and read them while listening to the songs? Then came
cassettes, and
the packaging was smaller, and lyrics sometimes fell by the wayside.
CDs
were still worse. And MP3s? Forget about it. But we like reading
lyrics, and we thought maybe you'd like to read ours. Here are some.
And
we'll be be adding more soon.<br><br>

<br>
You kept me waiting for so long, I fell apart inside.<br>
If I&#8217;d waited any more, I swear I would've died.<br>
A bitter kind of poison filled me through and through,<br>
But it was that poison that brought me back to you.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
Charity, Charity,</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">You&nbsp; done me
wrong, <br>
But I love you just the same.</span><br>
<br>
There&#8217;s one disease in my gut, the other in my head.<br>
One may make me miserable, the other make me dead.<br>
As for the one, well, that&#8217;s the way I came,<br>
But as for the other, only you&#8217;re you&#8217;re to blame.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
Charity...</span><br>
<br>
Everlys and Demerol, I dream the days away.<br>
I&#8217;d like to stay forever and dream my life away.<br>
You stabbed me in the gut and told me it&#8217;s ok,<br>
Pumped me full of morphine and sent me on my way.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
Charity...<br>

Suppose It's Funny</h3>
<span class="song-credit small-stuff">D. Olivier</span><br>
<br>
I suppose it's funny to call me "honey"
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">And then walk
out on me.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">I reckon it's a
blast to say our love will last</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">And then tell me
you're setting me free.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">I guess there's
nothing wrong with leading me along</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">And then
deciding to change your plans,</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">But before you
go I've got to know</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">So won't you
help me understand?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
If love's a joke</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px; font-style: italic;">Why
ain't I smiling?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px; font-style: italic;">If
love's a game</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px; font-style: italic;">Why
am I crying?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px; font-style: italic;">All
your cheating and all your lying</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px; font-style: italic;">Just
don't seem funny to me.</p>
<br>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">I reckon it's a
hoot to give me the boot,</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Then find some
other man,</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">But I've got to
say that I don't think</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Very highly of
that plan.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">You just want to
have some fun,</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">But I just want
to die.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Before you go,
I've got to know,</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">So won't you
tell me why?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
If love's a joke...</span></p>
<br>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">I guess there's
nothing wrong with playing games</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">And treating me
like a fool,</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">But didn't you
ever learn the words</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">To that old
Golden Rule,</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">'Cause what goes
around comes around.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Someday you will
pay.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Someone'll break
your heart in two.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Then you too
will say...</p>
<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
If love's a joke...<br>
<br>
</span>
<h3 class="song-title"><a name="Its_a_Joke"></a>It's
a Joke</h3>
<span class="song-credit small-stuff">D. Olivier</span><br>
<br>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Come on, baby.
You knew this wouldn't last.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">The place for us
is in the past.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px; font-style: italic;">It's
a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.</p>
<br>
Come on, baby.
Don't you be so dim.
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">This whole thing
was just a whim.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px; font-style: italic;">It's
a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.</p>
<br>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Aw, honey,
honey, won't you give me a break?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">There ain't
nothing wrong with a little heartache.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Aw, honey,
honey, I think you misheard.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">I didn't say, "I
love you". I said, "This is absurd."</p>
<br>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Things will be
the
way they'll be,</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">And maybe
someday you'll come to see</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px; font-style: italic;">It's
a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.</p>
<br>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Come
on, baby. This was a-okay,
</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">But now I think
I'm on my way.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px; font-style: italic;">It's
a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.</p>
<br>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Come on, baby.
This
was lots of fun,</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">But now I think
it's
time to run.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px; font-style: italic;">It's
a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.</p>
<br>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Aw, honey,
honey, don't you be mad.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">You're just
going to make me feel bad.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Don't tell me
this is how it's going to be:</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Me laughing at
you and you crying at me.</p>
<br>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">Things will go
the
way they'll go.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;">We can wish they
wouldn't. It'll still be so.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px; font-style: italic;">It's
a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.</p>

<span class="small-stuff">Note:
&nbsp;This is not
how the lyrics are sung on the album. That's because Dave goofed during
the recording.&nbsp;This is also not how the lyrics are sung during
many of our live shows. That's because Dave often goofs during those
too.&nbsp;Dave has a chronic block against singing this song
correctly, even though he wrote it. He's weird that way.<br>

Cup</h3>
<span class="small-stuff">M. Tuminaro</span><br>
<br>
Will you swim with me, Baby, in the River of Love?<br>
Will you hold my head up when I&#8217;ve had enough?<br>
Sometimes when I feel I&#8217;m sinking, I reach for you and start thinking<br>
That you&#8217;re kind to hold me up.<br>
<br>
Can you take my arrow going thru your heart?<br>
If my aim is off, will you move your mark?<br>
If I close one eye and tighten my grip, I&#8217;ll let it fly right<br>
Hope it rips you right thru your target heart.<br>
<br>
Will you play my card while I&#8217;m at the bar?<br>
I can&#8217;t see the illuminated screen cuz it&#8217;s too far.<br>
Upon my return you start grinning<br>
I realize I&#8217;m the winner and we drink<br>
From the Loving Cup.<br>
<br>
<h3 class="song-title"><a name="Why_Do_They_Love_Me"></a>Why Do They Love Me?</h3>
<span class="small-stuff">M. Tuminaro</span><br>
<br>
I go around town wonderin&#8217;, &#8220;Why do people love me?&#8221;<br>
I call up my good friend, ask her, &#8220;Why do they love me?&#8221;<br>
People say I&#8217;m sweet.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m sweet!&#8221;, but only to a limit.<br>
Yeah, I go around town wonderin&#8217;, &#8220;Why do they love me?&#8221;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">I go around town
wonderin&#8217;, &#8220;Why do they love me?&#8221;</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">I go around town
wonderin&#8217;, &#8220;Why do they love me?&#8221;</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">I go around town
wonderin&#8217;, &#8220;Why do they love me?&#8221;</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Yeah...!</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br>
My grandmom told me one day, &#8220;You will be a pretty lady.<br>
You&#8217;re so sweet! When you gonna have a baby?&#8221;<br>
People say I&#8217;m sweet.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m sweet!&#8221;, but only to a limit.<br>
Yeah, I go around town wonderin', &#8220;Why do they love me?&#8221;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">I go around town...</span><br>
<br>
Maybe s&#8217;cuz I&#8217;m funny. Maybe s&#8217;cuz I&#8217;m busy.<br>
Ain&#8217;t got time to get chatty. Ain&#8217;t got time for nothing serious.<br>
People say I&#8217;m sweet.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m sweet!", but only to a limit.<br>
Yeah I go around town wonderin&#8217;, &#8220;Why do they love me?&#8221;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">I go around town...</span><br>
