<h2>Who are We?</h2>
<h3><img style="width: 89px; height: 120px; float: left;" alt="Mary" src="images/headshot-mary.png">Mary "Cajun
Queen" Tuminaro
</h3>
Former
<a href="http://www.vpla.com/">Ville Platte</a>
Cotton Festival singing Goodwill Ambassador, now chanteuse
and drum-banger extraordinaire. Mary has total recall of every song
played on AM radio between 1972 and 1985 and can sing any (or all) of
them any time it suits her.<br>
<h3><img style="width: 84px; height: 130px; float: left;" alt="Jason" src="images/headshot-jason.png">Jason
"Fingers of Flame" Goodman</h3>
Madman
guitarist like you've never seen. True, he claims that in the
indeterminate but not too distant future he's heading off to the
temperate Northwest, but we're busily trying to clone him or build a
cyborgean replica (or if those don't work, we'll hide his car keys).<br>
<h3><img style="width: 91px; height: 130px; float: left;" alt="David" src="images/headshot-david.png">David
"Big Head" Olivier</h3>
From
the wilds of Africa to the hills of Virginia, David spent much of his
youth living&nbsp; in places where he needed to holler really
loudly.
Now he hollers loudly for the entertainment of others while
simultaneously strumming his baritone guitar. When not otherwise
engaged, he posts stuff on his blog, <a href="http://slimbolala.blogspot.com/">Slimbolala</a>.
You should go there.
You'll like it.</div>

We believe it's worth all the exclamation points! Yay!<br>
<br>
<span class="small-stuff">* We're not going to call it a
Bruiser's-Last-Show, because there have already been several that were
rumored as such, but we will say that it is <span style="font-style: italic;">one</span> of our last
shows
with Jason, and we won't necessarily know for sure which is the last
until it's already past. (Jason is a mysterious man with a mysterious
plan.) And anyway, in this crazy thing called life, when do we ever
know what tomorrow holds? So <span style="font-style: italic;">carpe</span>
that <span style="font-style: italic;">diem</span>,
and come on down! (Yay!)<br>

<img style="width: 180px; height: 120px; float: left;" alt="Studio in the Country" src="images/stitc-small.png">The
new album has been rumored for years to exist (well,
two years) but has never before been seen or heard. Now at last, it's
brought to the light of day (figuratively speaking&#8212;it's actually going
to be pretty dark at the show), twelve original country-punk
gems.&nbsp;'Twas a balmy summer Sunday in 2008 when three eager
young Bruisers
drove across the Causeway, past the pines of the North Shore, through
the pungent paper mill funk of Bogalusa to<a href="http://www.myspace.com/studiointhecountry2"> Studio in
the
Country</a> where, under the expert stewardship of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/benmumphrey">Ben Mumphrey</a>,
they laid
down a dozen-and-change scorching tracks&#8212;<img style="width: 188px; height: 125px; float: right;" alt="Jason and Mary at Studio in the Country" src="images/jason-and-mary-small.png">live, no overdubs, no
slicing
or splicing, certified autotune-free, now brought to you in all their
rough-hewn glory.&nbsp;Why'd it take so long
to get released? With Bruisers
New Orleans, the question is really, how'd it happen so quickly? (We've
still never released that Sun Studios stuff, but we're working on that
too.) But we think it's a fine CD, well worth the wait, and we hope you
will too.<br>

<h3>Our brand spankin' new website!</h3>
Which
sort of makes it sound like we already had a tattered old website,
which is not actually true, because in our ten-plus years of existence,
we somehow never got around to it. But you know we've got one now
beccause you're looking at it. It's pretty, huh? And though it's just a
scrappy little runt of a thing now, we're adding new stuff all the
time, so keep coming back.<br>

Look at that little red wax "B"-seal on the back. Isn't that cute? And
it plays real good music too.
